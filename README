Use a SVN repo to host your forum files and update your forum from that repo.

No direct editing, never overwrite each others changes. You will always have the option to revert the changes and go back to a earlier version of your files.

Never run your forum directly from a SVN repo, create a user with read-only access for the forum and update from ACP.

Assuming you have a working knowledge of SVN and how to set file permissions on your server, then this is a piece of cake.
